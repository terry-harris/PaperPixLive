Please consider the scripts for OpenWrt to be highly experimental 
for the time being.

As of now, these have just been translated from the Debian/Ubuntu
scripts in order to reflect particularites related to opkg (nstead of apt)
or ash/busybox (rather than bash).

There is NO UCI INTEGRATION at the moment,which means
that you will not see what the script does in any way in luci
(i.e. the web interface) or even commandline UCI

Simply put in other terms, your wbinterface will not show you what's happening.

So - again - HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL
